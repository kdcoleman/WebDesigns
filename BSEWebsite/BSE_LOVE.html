When we booked our venue we were told we would have a coordinator to help with everything, so I thought we would be fine. That was not the case. Three weeks prior to my wedding, we had to part ways with our original decorator. We contacted Bridgette who explained what services she could provide. She made sure we had all of the flowers for the bridal party, in addition to decorations for the reception area, candy buffet, and our sweetheart table. The venue coordinator's services didn't come close to the services that Bridgette provided for my husband and I. Her wonderful spirit made everything less stressful. Thanks to Bridgette my wedding was everything I dreamed of and so much more!!!"</p><br>

<p>"Three weeks before my daughter's wedding, we were informed that her decorator was unable to render her services which caused us to panic. I called Bridgette and within a week she had already made arrangements to get all the flowers my daughter requested for both the bridal party and the reception. Bridgette stayed in close contact with my daughter and I all while being in a different state. She went over every detail my daughter wanted and made sure that everything came together for the reception. Bridgette also took care of the ceremony details so we could be stress free. Minutes before the ceremony, I looked into the reception ballroom and it was beautiful. Every detail was to perfection. I was so overwhelmed with tears of joy. Everything was just the way my daughter wanted it. Bridgette's services were awesome!"</p><br>

We had already decided on the destination, dinner, cake, etc., when we realized that we really needed someone to actually coordinate everything. Bridgette ran down a checklist to be sure we hadn't overlooked anything and made suggestions on any decisions we still needed to make. It was great to have her to deal with all the little details on the big day, so that we didn't have to worry about a thing! We never could've pulled off such a perfect wedding day without Bridgette!"</p><br>

There wasn't a huge amount of time to prepare for our wedding, but she stepped in and helped with everything. She offered a lot of ideas which relieved so much of the stress of planning. That meant alot to me! Our wedding was everything we wanted and more.  She took care of it all, even those very little things, so we could enjoy our wedding day. She has a great spirit which made working with her even more enjoyable. She was not only our wedding planner, but she truly became a friend!  If you want high quality service along with a great personality, I would indeed recommend her as your wedding planner!"</p><br>

It's not often you can find someone to trust with one of the most important days of your life. I thank God we found that in Bridgette!"</p><br>
